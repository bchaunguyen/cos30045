- Introduction:
This project explores a dataset published by the Australian Government that contains information about the energy consumption of televisions sold in Australia. The aim of this data story is to analyse trends in TV screen technologies, screen sizes, brands, and energy efficiency, and to present the findings using clear and accessible visualisations.

- Audience Overview:
The primary audience for this data story is Australian consumers who are interested in purchasing a television and want to better understand how different screen sizes, screen technologies, and brands affect energy consumption. 
- Audience Interests:
  What types of TV screen technologies are available in Australia,
  Which screen sizes are most common.
  Whether there are differences in energy consumption between brands.
The visualisations are designed to help users compare options easily and make informed, energy-conscious purchasing decisions.

- Data Source:
The dataset was published by the Australian Government that contains energy rating information for registered television models sold in Australia. 
- Data source link:

- Data Processing:
The data was processed and cleaned using KNIME Analytics Platform. The following steps were applied:
  Removing duplicate records and irrelevant columns,
  Handling missing values using appropriate techniques,
  Converting screen size from centimetres to inches,
  Standardising brand names and screen technology labels,
  Creating derived variables where required for visualisation
- Privacy:
The dataset does not contain any personal or sensitive information. All records relate to commercial television products, so there are no privacy concerns.
- Accuracy and Limitations:
  The dataset may not include every television model currently available on the market.
  Some fields contain missing or inconsistent values, which may affect the precision of the analysis.
  The data represents a snapshot in time and may not reflect recent changes in product availability.
- Ethics:
The data has been used responsibly and solely for educational purposes. All findings are presented honestly, and limitations of the dataset are clearly acknowledged to avoid misleading conclusions.
- AI Declaration:
Artificial Intelligence tools were used to assist with the development of the website code, including HTML, CSS, and basic scripting support.
